  2. responsive.css -- _contains the responsive CSS element configuration._

#### HTML files:
  1. index.html -- _the one and only html page. The li elements act as the
  cards. By manipulating the classes, the cards can be turned over and matched_

#### Validation Results:
  1. HTML: Errors - validator didn't like the use of 'type' attribute on the li.
  nor did it like that my section.score-panel had no heading; however it really
  isn't needed.
  2. CSS: PASSED - no errors found in either responsive.css or app.css
  3. JS: Errors - JSLint didn't like the 'currentIndex' declaration.
